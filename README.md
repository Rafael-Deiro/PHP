# PHP
My adventures and experiments with PHP.

I made this repo to store snippets from my adventures and experiments with Vanilla PHP and maybe some databases.<br>
I use store these codes for future uses, so I don`t need to type them again when starting a new project.<br>
Feel free to use them as well! ^-^

The codes are separated by areas (what they deal with or fit in), code type (such as DAO, Model, Library, etc.), and if applicable, extension (e.g. MySQLi, PDO, etc.).<br>
Some other languages may appear, probably for interaction codes (JS <-> PHP, Python <-> PHP, ...).<br>
Some documentation can show up as well as some small apps (robots, managers, panels, etc.).<br>

That`s all for now!<br>
If you see something that is wrong, not secure, or can get better, please issue an issue (AHA!).<br>
